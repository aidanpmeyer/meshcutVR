# UnityLighsaber
A Lighsaber modelled in blender and brought to life in unity
 
I modelled a Lighstaber in blender, you can find the blender file in the BlenderFiles folder. I then imported it into unity and using Unities shader graph I created a glow effect for the blade and blade trail. The blade trail is procedurally generated, 12 triangles are drawn per frame to create the effect.

Once you've opened the project in unity, navigate to the scenes folder and open the sample scene, I have setup a basic demo of the Lighsaber prefab.

The Mesh cutting scene is called CutStuff.
